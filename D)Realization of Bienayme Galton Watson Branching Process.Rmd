5.2. Let {Xn,n ∈ N} be a Bienayme-Galton-Watson Branching Process with offspring distribution specified by probability generating function as g (s) = 0.25 + 0.35s + 0.3s^2 + 0.1s^3.If X0=3 then obtain realization of {Xn,n ∈ N} for n = 0,1,··· ,8, Xn denote size of nth generation.
```{r}
S=c(0,1,2,3,4);
P=c(0.25,0.35,0.3,0.3,0.1);P;
x=c(rep(0,8))
x[1]=3
for(i in 1:8)
{
  x[i+1]=sum(sample(S,size=x[i],replace=T,prob=P))

5.3. Let {Xn,n ∈ N} be a Bienayme-Galton-Watson Branching Process with offspring distribution given
by P[ξ = 0] = 0.1,P[ξ = 1] = 0.2,P[ξ = 2] = 0.15,P[ξ = 3] = 0.2,P[ξ = 4] = 0.25,P[ξ = 5] = 0.1.If X0 = 1,then realize X1,X2,··· ,X7 where Xn denote size of nth generation.
```{r}
S=c(0,1,2,3,4,5)
P=c(0.1,0.2,0.15,0.2,0.25,0.1);P
x=c(rep(0,8))
x[1]=1
for(i in 1:7)
{
  x[i+1]=sum(sample(S,size=x[i],replace=T,prob=P))
